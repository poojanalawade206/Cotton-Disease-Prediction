# Cotton-Disease-Prediction
This project aims to predict diseases affecting cotton plants using machine learning techniques. By analyzing images of cotton leaves, the system identifies common diseases such as Fusarium Wilt and Verticillium Wilt. The goal is to assist farmers in early detection and management of these diseases, thereby improving crop yield and reducing losses.
